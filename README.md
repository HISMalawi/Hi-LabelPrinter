# Introduction
This script helps to detect label files downloaded through a web browser with file extensions of `.lbl` or `.zpl`
and dispatches print commands to the default printer.

# Requirements
1. Ubuntu 22.0
2. python3

# Ubuntu installation
1. Open the terminal and ensure you're in the root directory of the application
2. Enter the following command to begin setup process: `sudo ./setup.sh`
3. Once installation is complete, you may want to restart your computer or run `systemctl start HILabelPrinter`

# TODOs:
1. Compile this into executionable file that can be easily installed
2. Add printer name configuration instead of depending on default printer provided by os
3. Windows support
